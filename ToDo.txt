List of Issues ELEMIK 2022

Clone repo by clicking Vs Code button. You now have a local repo (folder) on your harddrive. Take note where it is.
In Vs Code, add folder /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/ to the workspace so you have both folders in sight. Save the workspace in your local repo folder. Use this next time you want to work with the code. 

Install the Circuitpython v2 extension.

Ask Copilot how to create a task within VS code to copy your Pyportal's files to the local repo. This should be done before committing, since the local repo is on your HDD.

Read the first learning guide, intro. Read up and including "Internet connect", start your first project by copying it. Learn how to use circup (regularly). Be sure to update the ESP32 firmware, as instructed in the guide.
Download the latest bundle so you have all the examples.

Create an issue for each of the TODOs below. You can do this inside VS code, or on github.dev.

Edit the code.py on your CPY and when an issue is solved, run your task to copy to local repo and commit/push with "Resolved #..." message.

* Install latest CircuitPython and update libraries. 
* Make one commit per issue resolved. Note it's only the local repo, not the code on the CPY that is pushed to the remote repo
* Use lists and for loops as much as possible.
* Keep track of memory use with gc.memfree()
